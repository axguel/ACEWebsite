<h1 class="text-primary">Lesson 12: How Can My Business Bless My Family Now and in the Future?</h1>
<hr>
<p>Consider these questions as you  prepare for this lesson:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Are the rewards of owning my own business worth the added stress and pressure that are part of my everyday life?
</li>
<li>How can I involve my family members in my business activities?
</li>
<li>What can I do to ensure that my temporal success will increase—not detract from—the spiritual stability of my family?
</li>
<li>How can I ensure that my family’s temporal success will continue for generations?</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Main ideas to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you will work for three to five years like no one else will, you can live the rest of your life like no one else can.
</li>
<li>Your business must never replace your family as the most important thing in your life. The business is there to serve your family’s needs—not the other way around.
</li>
<li>Breaking the chains of family poverty by growing a business will bless generations.  A stable business can become a family asset that can generate money for children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<p>New words:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Habit:	An act repeated so often by an individual that it becomes automatic.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As you reach the end of this workbook, let’s take a look back at the central question this curriculum addresses: How can I lift my family from poverty to prosperity?  By now, you know the answer—learn some fundamental business principles, start an income-generating activity, and work on it until it becomes a full-fledged, successful business.
No matter where you are on that path, we hope you feel like you have at least begun the journey toward an abundant life.  Here are a few parting words of advice and encouragement.
<br>
<br>
Initial sacrifices lead to long-term prosperity
<br>
You are probably discovering for yourself that during the early months and years of your business, you must make
many sacrifices. You may arrive at work in the early hours of the morning and leave late at night.  You probably think about and work in your business all day and work on your business at night. At times you may think you are working very hard and not receiving much benefit.  Stresses have likely accumulated in your life and in the lives of your family members.  However, it is at this point in time that you must remember the saying, “If I work for three to five years like no one else will, then I can live the rest of my life like no one else can.”
<br>
<br>

Explain what you are willing to sacrifice now so that you can live the life that you want to live in the future.
<br>
<br>

Even though sacrificing some things is necessary, there are some things that you should not sacrifice in order to have a successful business.  Your faith, family, and integrity should always come before your business—not only because they are the most important things in life but also because you can be a better business person with them than
without them.  Your faith in the Lord can give you strength to continue when times are difficult; your family can serve as a constant reminder of why you are in business to begin with; and your integrity should be so central to who
you are and what you do that it can not be compromised.  You must never trade what you want most in life for what
you want now.

Success story: Sacrifices pay  off!
<br>
Peter Caro is a top graduate from the Academy for Creating Enterprise (in the Philippines).  He came to the
Academy shy and quiet, but his life experiences had prepared him for the hard work of growing several businesses.
<br>
<br>

Peter was born into a poor family.  His father was very sick and couldn’t work to support his family, so Peter learned how to work hard at the young age of seven.  After serving a mission and marrying in the temple, he and his new wife moved into their first home—a renovated pigpen! They struggled each day to put food on the table.  While visiting a family member one day, Peter saw a tricycle lying in the yard.  He asked if he could borrow it to taxi people around the small city. They agreed, and he happily took it and began earning money.  The income he gained from that small income-generating activity enabled him to get more education.  He learned carpentry, welding, masonry, and plumbing. However, he and his wife still needed more money.
<br>
<br>

After having the opportunity to study business principles at the Academy for Creating
Enterprise, Peter returned to his town a new man.  He was offered the opportunity to
operate a Cellular City franchise.  He didn’t have enough money to buy the franchise, so he started gathering money from friends and family members—with the promise to repay the
money as quickly as he could.
<br>
<br>

The early months of Peter’s business were difficult.  He worked very long hours. His wife worked with him as his bookkeeper.  During the day, they worked in the business; at night, they worked on the business. They worked while others slept. They fought to remain positive while others doubted their chances for success.  But, finally, the sacrifices began to pay off.
<br>
<br>

Peter’s single franchise, selling cell phones, became successful fairly quickly because of the long hours and hard work Peter put into it.  He then expanded to cell phone accessories and calling plans.  Once that franchise was successfully established with good systems and dependable employees, he opened a second franchise. After that one had expanded, he began branching out into other businesses: a print shop, an advertising agency, a travel agency, a water-purifying business, and a bag-making business. Altogether, the businesses now have more than 5 million pesos of operating capital!
<br>
<br>

Peter looks back on the hard work and sacrifice of the early years and, without reservation, says that they were worth it—that his current success could not have been possible had he not struggled so much at the beginning.  He learned to work hard, solve problems, be creative, rely on his wife and on the Lord, take control of his life, and make his business profitable.  He learned to keep doing the right things—even though they were often hard to do—until they became second-nature for him.  He personified a saying from President Heber J. Grant: “That which we persist in doing becomes easier for us to do; not that the nature of the thing has changed, but that our power to do it is increased” (Conference Report, Apr. 1901, p. 63). The skills he developed while struggling to make that first franchise successful have given him a sense of confidence that could not have been developed any other way.  The financial independence and stability he and his family now enjoy are the blessings that came from his sacrifices and faith.
<br>
<br>
 
What blessings are you already seeing as a result of your efforts to sacrifice?
<br>
<br>

Family and business
<br>
One rewarding benefit of owning and operating your own business is that you can include your family in your work. In the early stages of your business, you will spend a lot of time at your booth or store or office. With so much work to do and only 24 hours to do it in, you will need to be creative in your efforts to balance the various aspects of your
life.  You may find that involving your family in your business is an excellent way to spend quality time with your spouse and children while also devoting the necessary time to your business.  (As a caution, remember that when
making hiring decisions, you must be very careful to select employees based on their qualifications and skills—not on their familial ties to you. But when it comes to children and spouses, sometimes you can create an environment in which they “pitch in” and help build the family business without being formal employees and incurring undue
risk.)
<br>
<br>

In The Family: A Proclamation to the World, Church leaders declared, “Successful marriages and families are established and maintained on principles of faith, prayer, repentance, forgiveness, respect, love, compassion, work, and wholesome recreational activities” (Ensign, Nov. 1995, 102; emphasis added). Working as a family brings family members closer together.  It enables parents to teach children how to work hard, how to contribute to a family goal, and how to develop skills and build self-esteem.
<br>
<br>

What activities do you enjoy doing with your family? Why do you enjoy them?
<br>
<br>

Does your family work together often?  What do you enjoy most about working with your family?  What benefits do you see from working together?
<br>
<br>

Working side by side with your spouse and children can certainly help your business while also building family unity.  For example, your children might enjoy sweeping the floors, washing the windows, taking out the trash, and running errands after hours. Your spouse might enjoy compiling your daily records into a more permanent book or helping create the products you sell.
<br>
<br>

What specific things might members of your family enjoy doing in your business? Would those activities allow you to spend more time with them?
<br>
<br>

Your  business can become your family’s legacy
<br>
As you involve your family in your business, you can train your children to eventually take over the business, open
their own franchise of your business, or specialize in certain aspects of your business like accounting or purchasing. Rudy, an Academy graduate, is doing just that with his son, Omar.
<br>
<br>
 
Not long ago, Rudy started a business selling industrial and household water filters.
<br>
Rudy’s teenaged son, Omar, was excited about his father’s new business, so Rudy included his son in the business as much as possible.  It was not uncommon to see them working together for several hours each day.  Omar swept the floors, ran errands, and visited new customers with his father. Rudy wanted to teach Omar the joys of owning and managing a business.
<br>
<br>

Rudy had a very long-term outlook on his business.  He worked hard every day, but his efforts were always applied to building his business into something that could last for generations.  He viewed his business as the vehicle that would help him break out of poverty, something that he could leave to his children when he died, something his family could own and operate for decades to come.  He wanted to eventually turn the business over to his son, so he included Omar as much as possible.
<br>
<br>

Rudy recalled how one day, after collecting payment for some water filters, he looked at his son and asked, “Do you think we could have ever earned that much money in a day if we were working for someone else?”  Omar smiled and agreed that a “real job” never would have paid as much money.
<br>
<br>

Later that week, they visited a grocery store together on their way home from work.  They walked from aisle to aisle, picking out the foods they needed without worrying about the price. They didn’t spend money on frivolous items, but they got everything they needed— something they never would have been able to do before Rudy started his business.
<br>
<br>

Although Rudy’s family had lived in poverty for generations, they are now living comfortably.  They have a house and land, a car, and a business that makes a profit every week.  And with hard work, diligent teaching, and a little bit of planning, Omar and his siblings will enjoy the same blessings when they have families of their own.  And so will their children and their children’s children . . .
<br>
<br>

What daily stresses have been eliminated because Rudy started his own business?
<br>
<br>

What important lessons has Rudy taught his son because he is working in the family business?
<br>
<br>

Final  writing assignment: 
<br>
How can your business be a legacy for your family  members? You have now reached the end of this workbook.  You may have started reading these lessons with a simple question: “How can I provide a better life for my family?”  We hope that you better understand how establishing a profitable business can change your life.  In fact, we hope your life is already changing because you are already applying these lessons in your very own business and seeing results.
<br>
<br>

As a way to help you review what you have learned about your business and personal goals, please write a letter to your children and grandchildren, explaining why you started your business and are working so hard on it.  Focus
 
your attention on why you feel having a business is important.   Also, discuss the blessings of prosperity and stability your business is starting to bring to your family.  Make this a truly personal letter.  Include personal ambitions, record your true feelings, and give concrete examples of how you expect your family's  life to change--or  how it already has changed.  Explain what new habits you are developing in your life to prepare yourself for success.  For example, you may want to explain the sacrifices you are making now (short-term) so that you may have success (long-term).  You may want to explain the conditions of poverty that you come from so that future generations can understand how you have helped break the chains of poverty.
<br>
<br>

Bottom line
<br>
In order to become prosperous and better provide the necessities  of life for your family, you will have to make many initial sacrifices.  If you will remember to put the Lord, your family, and your integrity first, your other short-term sacrifices will eventually pay off and help your family prosper for generations to come.
