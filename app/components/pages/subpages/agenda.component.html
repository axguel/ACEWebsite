        <p>Success in business isnâ€™t reserved for those who are born with natural talent. 
            Success can be achieved when correct principles are taught and applied in business. 
            Each month in group meetings, a business skill will be highlighted, which if implemented will lead to greater success of the business.</p>
        <p>These agendas provide lesson material for each of these business skills.</p>
