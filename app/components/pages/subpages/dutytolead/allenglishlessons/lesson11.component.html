<h1 class="text-primary">Lesson 11: Using Delegation to Create More Success</h1>
<hr>
<p>There’s an old saying among mentors: You can either do
the work of ten people or get ten people to do the work.
Effective leaders soon realize that they can’t do everything
themselves. In order to be successful, you must learn to trust
others, motivate them to help, and give them clear direction
on assigned tasks. Wise, strategic delegation not only enables
an organization to prosper but also helps individuals
to grow, as they participate in increasing the organization’s
success.
<br>
It’s one thing for an employer to delegate tasks to his or her
paid employees. It’s quite another, however, to successfully
delegate within a volunteer organization. When people aren’t
paid for their efforts, they need to feel rewarded in other
ways. When we publicly recognize and thank people for
what they do, they’ll be more willing to help, and they’ll be
more satisfied with the results of their service. In this way,
we can build a culture of successful delegation.
What other tools and techniques do successful leaders use
to motivate volunteers to perform important tasks?
<br>

Delegating Effectively in Your Chapter
<br>
In order to delegate, first decide what tasks need to be performed
in your chapter. Whenever we request someone to
do something for us, we must provide details about what we
want accomplished by when. One powerful tool of delegation
is writing out exactly what tasks need doing and their
deadlines to be completed.
<br>
Work closely with your chapter leadership—your vice presidents
and secretary—to determine assignments for each
other and for other chapter members. As you plan which
tasks to delegate, remember that it’s often wiser to assign
smaller tasks to a larger number of volunteers, rather than
big tasks to a small number of people. With the first approach,
you can avoid overwhelming volunteers with too
much work. Also, if one person fails to complete his or her
task, others can more easily pick up the slack.
<br>
After you delegate tasks with clear instructions and firm
deadlines, the next step is holding people accountable. Latter-day
Saints are familiar with the phrase “return and report.”
<br>
We recommend that you establish a regular meeting
during which people know they’ll always be expected to return
and report on their assignments. As President Thomas
S. Monson has taught us, “When performance is measured,
performance improves. When performance is measured and
reported, the rate of improvement accelerates.”
<br>
For additional strength and power, consider creating a special
outreach committee in your chapter. To do so, iden-
tify ten chapter members who are strong, motivated, and
moving forward on the pathway to success. Ask them to
commit to two hours of chapter work each month. Assign
these helpers to reach out to other chapter members, mentor
them, help them get the most out of their chapter membership,
and otherwise carry out the chapter’s vision. For maximum
effectiveness, choose ten helpers who are geographically
spread throughout the chapter’s territory.
<br>
By delegating effectively with clear, specific tasks and
strong accountability follow-up, you will create a multiplying
effect that will mark you as an effective leader. Not only
will your chapter improve significantly, but if you use these
same tools in your family, your business, and your church
leadership responsibilities, your life will become easier
even as you enjoy more productivity and success.

My Action Items:
<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down some urgent tasks in your chapter that
need to be delegated.
</li>

<li>Identify ten chapter members who would be good
candidates for serving on an outreach committee.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Spiritual Application:
<br>

“When leaders and teachers wisely delegate responsibilities
by drawing upon others’ abilities and resources,
they will multiply their efforts, build relationships
of trust, and provide opportunities for growth, leadership,
and motivation.”

Additional Insights:
<br>

“If you want to do a few small things right, do them
yourself. If you want to do great things and make a big
impact, learn to delegate.”
