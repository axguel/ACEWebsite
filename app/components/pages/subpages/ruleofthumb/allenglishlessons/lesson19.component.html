<h1 class="text-primary">Lesson 19: Have Written Agreements</h1>
<hr>
<p> 
    Allan and Ren, childhood friends, have always been involved in entrepreneurial pursuits.  When they turned 21, they decided to stop working as delivery boys for the local newspaper and start
a business of their own. They loved the breads that were sold in larger cities near their homes, so they decided to start baking and selling freshly baked bread.
<br>
<br>
They enthusiastically jumped right into business. They did some research, decided which partner would do which activities, opened their doors, and began selling their delicious bakery goods.  Their business built a strong reputation quickly; before the year was over, they had opened six booths in locations around the neighborhood.
<br>
<br>

As the business grew, so did the tension and conflict between the two friends.  Most arguments were about two very important issues: their individual responsibilities for the company, and the sharing of profits.  Unable to resolve their conflicts or remember what they had originally agreed upon, Allan and Ren dissolved the partnership and closed down the business.  The death of the business came hand in hand with the death of their close friendship.

The  Principle—Have Written Agreements
<br>
Agreements are an essential, though often overlooked, part of business.  They take time to
create, but they can save business owners a lot of heartache and struggle in the long run.
Simply put, agreements are meant to protect business owners from a whole slew of things: false accusations, faulty memories and forgetfulness, abrupt policy changes by suppliers and land owners, claims of disgruntled employees or partners, and so forth.

<br>
<br>
A wise person once said, “The dullest pencil is better than the sharpest memory.”  The implied message of this saying is that none of us has a perfect memory and that recording important information—such as the details of our business agreements—is good protection against the negative consequences of our bad memories.  At the onset of any exciting undertaking, such as at the start of a business, the people involved are usually so focused on the opportunity and the successes they hope to have that they think things will always be perfect.  So they make a few informal plans and hand-shake agreements, and move forward with the work.  But because the memories of partners, suppliers, landlords, and creditors are imperfect, business owners must plan for the inevitable—the forgetting of essential information upon which business operations are based.  Start each new relationship with a written agreement (even if it’s written with the dullest pencil ever made) and make prompt written records of any changes that might affect the agreement.
<br>
<br>

Written agreements are great at solving problems that arise in the course of business.  But they also give prospective business partners an excellent opportunity to brainstorm all of the important issues that have the potential to affect the business.  Having an open and honest discussion about business-related issues (e.g., profit sharing, contract length, pricing, division of responsibilities, what to do if the business splits up) at the beginning of a new relationship enables all involved parties to understand other people’s perspectives and to either feel comfortable with the arrangements or get out before any serious damage is done.
<br>
<br>
 
Obstacles to Overcome
<br>
The obstacles that prevent most business owners from establishing a habit of recording their
agreements in writing are the result of popular but deceiving myths.
<br>
<br>

Myth #1: Agreements Reveal Mistrust
<br>
Many people think that an insistence on written agreements reveals mistrust between the parties
involved in the agreement.  When we receive requests to enter into a written agreement, we often react poorly by resenting the idea that our partner might not trust our integrity.
<br>
<br>

If you are met with this obstacle, work with the other person to ensure him or her that your real purpose for wanting an agreement is because you don’t want misunderstandings to get in the way of the good relationship that you already have.
<br>
<br>

Myth #2: Agreements are Time Consuming and Unnecessary
<br>
Many people fail to create important written agreements because they think that agreements
take a lot of time to develop and don’t really do any good in the end.  In reality, though, if all parties involved in the agreement have thought about what they need out of the relationship and are committed to satisfying the needs of the other people as well, agreement writing can be a very fast process and can have significant benefits for all people involved.  Even with more complex agreements that do in fact take a good deal of time, the assurance and stability produced by having an agreement will be well worth the investment of time.
<br>
<br>

For example, suppose that you find a great supplier and want to work with her.  Her warehouse is close to your shop, she offers bulk discounts, and her rates are 3 percent lower than other suppliers’ rates.  So you decide to use her as your main supplier.  You have an informal discussion during which you both agree that she will keep her prices set at their current rate for the next six months, and then you will re-evaluate the rates.  Your relationship is great for two months, but at the beginning of the third month, her rates increase significantly.  You remind her about your agreement, but she insists that the agreement was to keep the rates for just two
months.  You debate about it for ten minutes, but both of you insist that your memory is correct. Clearly, a written agreement would have benefited you in this situation.
<br>
<br>

Myth #3: Agreements are Complicated
<br>
A third myth that often prevents business owners from making written agreements is a lack of
understanding about how to write a proper agreement.  Basically, there is no such thing as a perfect template for written agreements.  The way to approach a new agreement is to decide what important decisions must be spelled out and then write a document that clearly and concisely describes those decisions.  For example, you and your partner might decide what jobs each person will do and what to do with the business assets if one partner later wants out of the business.  You and your suppliers might decide upon a bulk discount rate, how long prices are set for, if the supplier will be the business’ sole supplier, and so forth.  As long as the document spells out the important details of the agreement and is signed and dated by each person involved, the parties can be confident that their interests are protected.
<br>
<br>
 
Benefits of Applying the  Principle
<br>
Problems are a part of daily life for business owners.  Businesses are formed to solve problems
or meet needs; businesses change operations to meet arising needs or solve unforeseen problems; and business owners confront various problems as they seek to earn money and provide for their families.  By anticipating problems and writing down the solutions in a written agreement, you can protect yourself from the negative consequences of problems that may arise in the normal course of business.  Agreements provide stability, certainty, and a firm foundation upon which you can build relationships with people who are involved with your business.
