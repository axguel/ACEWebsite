<h1 class="text-primary">Lesson 2: Practice Separate Entities</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Alvin worked hard at his fish-selling business.  Every day, he used his 80 pesos of working capital to purchase 50 kilos of fish at the market. He then spent the day selling the fish to families in his neighborhood.  The average daily profit (the difference between what he spent on the fish and what he earned by selling it) of 75 pesos was enough to buy food for his family of five.  On really good sales days, when the profit was more than expected, Alvin would take the extra money home for his personal use.
<br>
<br>
One day, the unexpected happened—Alvin’s  wife got sick. The doctor said her condition could be treated only with fairly costly pills.  Alvin used all of the business’ working capital (money needed to start a business and buy inventory for the business to sell) to pay for the doctor’s visit and his wife’s much-needed medicine. With no money left to buy inventory, Alvin could no longer buy fish to sell.  He was out of business.
<br>
<br>

Alvin’s choice was clearly an easy one to make. Few people would fault him for choosing to care for his wife rather than save his business.  But the lesson to be learned from Alvin’s experience is that this kind of problem can be avoided.  If Alvin had followed the counsel to practice separate entities—to keep business money separate from personal money—he could have started saving long ago in order to be financially prepared for ongoing business expenses as well as for emergency personal needs.
<br>
<br>

The  Principle—Practice Separate Entities
<br>
When people decide to start a business, many struggle with knowing how to take care of the
money generated by their businesses transactions.  Most view both their personal money and the business’ money as being in the same pot.  The ability to separate business money from personal money is necessary for the growth of the business.  Business money and personal money need to be treated differently not only in the physical location of the money, but also in the mind of the microenterprise owner.  The more separation exists between the two kinds of money, the better off the business will be.
<br>
<br>

After your business is initially funded (whether through a loan or through the investment of personal funds), you must consider the business as a fully independent organization—an organization that is financially unrelated to your personal money.  As a microentrepreneur, you must communicate clearly with your family members and friends to ensure that they understand the separate nature of your business and personal assets.  Business money should be used
strictly for business-related purposes and must not be used for personal reasons.
<br>
<br>

Once this relationship is understood and established, treat yourself as an employee of the business.  In other words, calculate how much money you need daily to meet your personal needs, and withdraw that amount from the business as a daily salary.  Reinvest the remaining profit into the business.  Doing so will allow the business’ operational capital to increase, enabling you to purchase more products to sell.  Learn to live on the determined salary and let the working capital compound (i.e., accumulate or grow interest) for the business.  As more products are sold, more profit will be generated, and your salary can slowly be increased.
<br>
<br>
 
Obstacles to Overcome
<br>
Two obstacles that prevent business owners from following this principle are (1) temptations
caused by the limited amount of funds available to many microentrepreneurs and (2) desires for instant gratification.
<br>
<br>

Temptations Caused by Limited Funds
<br>
The practice of separate entities is almost nonexistent in microenterprises worldwide.  This
situation is largely due to the fact that many microenterprise owners have very little money to begin with, so the thought of not using all of their available money to meet their immediate needs seems foolish.  Because they were responsible for initially funding the business, they think of the business’ assets as their own—indistinguishable from their personal assets. Inventory items are used by family members and friends as if the items were the property of the family, not of the business.  Money is sometimes taken straight from the till or cash box for personal expenses.  And generally, no record is made of the “transaction,” so the business
owner has no way to track the movement of the money or goods that are taken out of the business by family members.
<br>
<br>

Avoid this obstacle by deciding to practice this rule of thumb before even opening your doors for business.  Commit yourself to seeing the business as something that is separate from you and your family, even though your money will be used to fund it initially.  By sticking to this commitment, you help yourself resist temptation to “borrow” from the business or “use”
business funds for personal needs.  And in the end, your initial investment—if left untouched in the business—will yield large financial dividends for you.
<br>
<br>

Desires For Instant Gratification
<br>
Another obstacle that business owners encounter in managing their separate financial accounts
involves the tradeoff between savings and spending.  They struggle to understand how investing money in the business in hope of increased future returns can benefit them more than spending, the money now on things they need.  They do not understand the relationship between delayed gratification and increased growth.
<br>
<br>

But in order to be successful, you must be disciplined in setting your salary and then not taking additional money from the business.  This discipline will enable you to invest in the business— a practice that will lead to higher profits in the future and to a bigger salary.
<br>
<br>

Benefits of Applying the  Principle
<br>
Practicing separate entities has many benefits for both the business and the owner.  First, when
you keep business funds and personal funds separate and when you consistently withdraw a reasonable salary from the business account, the business can grow.  The working capital can then compound (i.e., accumulate or grow interest) for the business.  Discipline in practicing separate entities now will lead to increased profits in the future.
<br>
<br>

Second, living off of a fixed salary serves as a powerful motivator to work hard and improve
the profitability of the business.  You need to commit yourself to provide sufficient money on a daily basis to support the personal needs of your family, and then work to make sure that you can do that without relying on the business’ funds.  If you know that taking money from the
business to meet unexpected personal needs will not be an option, you will work harder to ensure that you generate enough income to provide for all of your needs—even the emergency ones that are so unpredictable.  When this commitment to practicing separate entities is clear, you will work hard to meet your financial goals.
<br>
<br>

If practiced consistently, the separate entities rule of thumb will set you on the path toward self-reliance and lifting yourself out of poverty’s grasp.
